# Russian Missile Attacks on Ukraine
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of missile and UAV utilization within the Ukraine conflict, with a focus on deployment patterns, model-specific usage, and interception rates. Central to our examination is the impact of US sanctions on the deployment of Shahed-136/131 drones by Russia, informed by data sourced from Kaggle. The sanctions aimed at Iranian entities producing components for these UAVs offer a unique lens to gauge the interplay between international policy measures and military tactics.

Our findings highlight Russia's strategic preference for unmanned systems like the Shahed-136 for precision strikes, reflecting a broader tactical shift towards minimizing risk while maximizing operational impact. The analysis reveals a nuanced response to the sanctions, marked by an initial decrease in Shahed-136 launches, followed by a resurgence, suggesting an adaptive strategy to circumvent the sanctions' effects.

This study underscores the complexity of modern warfare, where technological advancements, strategic decisions, and international regulations converge. By providing a detailed overview of weapon system utilization and the efficacy of sanctions, this project contributes valuable insights to the discourse on contemporary military strategies and international security policy. Through rigorous data analysis, it aims to enhance understanding of the dynamics at play in the Ukraine conflict and inform future policy and strategic decision-making.

### Strategic Implications
**Tactical Advantage:** The deployment of UAVs like the Shahed-136 provides a tactical advantage, especially in urban warfare or in regions with difficult terrain. These UAVs can navigate obstacles and deliver explosives with precision, reducing collateral damage while maximizing the impact on the intended targets.

**Operational Efficiency:** The use of kamikaze UAVs also reflects a strategic approach that values operational efficiency. These UAVs can be deployed in large numbers due to their relatively lower cost and risk, compared to manned aircraft or larger missile systems.
**Technological Innovation:** The adoption of advanced UAVs underscores Russia's investment in innovative military technologies, enhancing its capabilities in modern warfare scenarios.
### Comparative Analysis
Diversity in Russian Arsenal: The variety of models, including cruise missiles and UAVs, indicates a diverse arsenal at Russia's disposal, enabling flexibility and adaptability in different combat situations.
Comparison with Iranian Models: Compared to Iranian models, Russian missiles and UAVs exhibit a broader range of capabilities, reflecting a comprehensive approach to aerial warfare and reconnaissance.

### Impact of U.S. Sanctions on Iranian Missile and UAV Deployment
The United States Institute of Peace provides a comprehensive timeline of U.S. sanctions against Iran. These sanctions target individuals, companies, and sectors pivotal to Iran's missile and UAV programs. An analysis of the missile and UAV deployment data reveals interesting trends that may correlate with these sanctions.

### Key Observations
**Period of Inactivity:** In March, coinciding with a phase of intensified sanctions, there was a slight lull in the launch of Iranian UAVs. This period of inactivity might suggest an immediate impact of the sanctions on Iranâ€™s operational capabilities or a strategic pause in response to international pressure.

**Subsequent Increase in UAV Usage:** Interestingly, only a month after this hiatus, there was a rapid increase in the deployment of Iranian Kamikaze drones. This surge could indicate Iran's adaptation to the sanctions, possibly through accelerated domestic development or alternative procurement strategies.

### Interpretation
**Short-term Effectiveness:** The initial drop in UAV activity following the imposition of sanctions suggests a short-term effectiveness in disrupting Iran's military operations.

**Long-term Adaptability:** The subsequent increase in UAV deployment, especially of Kamikaze drones, points to Iran's ability to adapt to sanctions over time. This might involve leveraging domestic production capabilities or finding innovative ways to circumvent the sanctions.

### Correlation Between Reconnaissance UAV Events and Subsequent Missile Strikes
A key aspect of our analysis focused on the relationship between reconnaissance UAV events and subsequent cruise missile strikes in Ukraine. We investigated the likelihood of a cruise missile event occurring at the same location as a UAV reconnaissance event within specific timeframes.

### Key Findings
**Within a 1-Day Window:** For every reconnaissance UAV event, there is approximately a **26.32%** chance of a corresponding cruise missile event occurring at the same location within a day.

**Within a 5-Day Window:** This probability increases to **47.37%** when the timeframe is extended to five days.

### Implications

**Strategic Coordination:** The findings indicate a significant level of strategic coordination between reconnaissance UAV activities and missile strikes. The increase in probability over a longer timeframe suggests a methodical approach to utilizing UAV-gathered intelligence for subsequent missile attacks.

**Operational Insights:** These statistics provide valuable insights into the operational tactics employed in Ukraine, particularly regarding the use of UAVs for surveillance and target acquisition in advance of missile strikes.

## Data-Driven Approach
**Methodology**: These percentages were calculated based on an analysis of historical data from missile attacks and UAV deployments in Ukraine.

**Accuracy and Reliability**: The figures are derived solely from recorded events, making it plausabile that these numbers may vary.

### Future Research
**Further Analysis:** Additional research could explore the factors influencing the time gap between UAV reconnaissance and missile strikes, potentially examining the types of targets and the strategic objectives of these missions.

**Broader Implications:** Extending this analysis to other regions or conflicts could provide a comparative perspective on the use of UAVs and missiles in modern warfare.

### Comparative Analysis of Russian Missile Resilience and Vulnerability in Ukraine
Our analysis unveils varied patterns of missile deployment and their susceptibility to being shot down in the context of the conflict in Ukraine. This analysis is particularly illuminating when comparing the operational resilience of different missile models.

### Key Findings
**Resilient Models:** The Russian surface-to-air C-300 missile and the X-22 cruise missile are the most frequently used missiles in attacks on Ukraine and notably have never been reported as shot down. This indicates a high level of operational effectiveness and evasion capabilities.

**Vulnerability of Shahed-136:** In stark contrast, the Shahed-136, a UAV Kamikaze bomber, has been the most shot down model. This suggests its increased vulnerability in the face of Ukraine's defense systems.

### Strategic Insights
**Defense System Effectiveness:** The high shoot-down rate of the Shahed-136 may point to the effectiveness of Ukraine's current defense systems against certain types of aerial threats, particularly UAVs.

**Adaptation and Response:** The contrasting resilience of the C-300 and X-22 missiles implies a need for Ukraine to adapt its defense strategies and possibly seek more advanced anti-missile technologies or international support to counter these threats.

### Implications for Defense Policy
**Enhancing Capabilities:** The data suggests a strategic imperative for Ukraine to enhance its missile defense capabilities, particularly against highly resilient models like the C-300 and X-22.

**Diversification of Defense Strategies:** Diversifying defense strategies to effectively counter different types of missiles, from surface-to-air to cruise and UAVs, is crucial.
